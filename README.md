# pfunctions

the pfunctions library is just my functions that replicate Python methods in C. One difference is that the variables must be passed to the functions first (whereas python methods operate on the variable that they are attached to).

My thought behind it all is that since puthon has a heap of methods built into the language like:
.count()
.isalpha()
.isalphanum()
.startswith()
.endswith()
etc.

I wanted to bring that functionality over to python.

My long term goal is to be able to make C as easy to use as python (To be honest, I think it is anyway. Maybe I mean that I want to make developing just as fast as python...).

A lot of functions might already have an equivolent in C and that is fine, but the names that I have created resemble the python names with an added lowercase p at the start of each function.
